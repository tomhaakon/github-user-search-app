## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

As suggested in the challange from frontend mentor, i made the design part first, html and css. Then I did javascript and tried different ways to make this work. My mentor at work pushed me to practice Pinia store, so I made that into this project even though it was not needed. Also tried to stick to mobile-first workflow.

### Built with

- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) - State management
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) - Component library for Tailwind CSS
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS frameowork
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

### What I learned

I learned so much about Pinia Store, tailwindcss and DaisyUI. I first tried to fetch the API with axios, but eneded to fetch the data with vues fetch. Ive never done any API stuff before either so that was also a huge learning for me.

### Continued development

For future I may add something for the search function as for now you can search for infinite text and every symbol. Want to restrain that. There are probably alot parts of this project that need adjusting which I may learn in the future.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) - Helped me alot when I got stuck. Finding mistakes and just helping me remember basic syntax.
